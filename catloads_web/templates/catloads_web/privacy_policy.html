                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Due to the digital nature of our products, we generally do not offer refunds. However, we will consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis under specific circumstances we outline (explained below).</p>

                                    <p>We will only provide refunds for products we explicitly list as refundable. For example, if we have a guide for sale with a money-back guarantee, we will offer a 100% refund if the guide demonstrably does not function as described. In such cases, customers will need to submit the required information to prove the guide is not working after following the instructions.</p>

Include your order number and a detailed explanation of why you are requesting a refund, along with any necessary supporting evidence (as outlined in point 2).</p>
